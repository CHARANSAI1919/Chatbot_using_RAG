# Chatbot_using_RAG
In this project, we built an intelligent chatbot using the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture, which combines retrieval-based and generative approaches. Unlike traditional chatbots that rely solely on a pre-trained language model, our RAG-based chatbot can search a knowledge base to fetch relevant information and then generate natural-sounding responses grounded in that content.

The RAG model consists of two main components:

- Retriever: Uses algorithms like DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval) to find the most relevant documents from a custom dataset or knowledge base.

- Generator: A pre-trained seq2seq model (like BART) that takes both the user query and the retrieved documents to generate a response.

This combination enables the chatbot to:

* Provide accurate and contextually rich answers

* Adapt dynamically to new information without retraining the full model

* Work well in domains like healthcare, education, or customer support

We used Hugging Face Transformers to implement the RAG pipeline and connected it with a domain-specific knowledge base. This allows our chatbot to answer factual or domain-specific queries with much higher reliability than a standalone language model.
